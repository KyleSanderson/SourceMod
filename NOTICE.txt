We now use svn:keywords "Id" on all .c/.cpp/.h/.inc/.sp/ files.
Please make sure your client is configured properly.

	- Open your Application Data directory.
		Windows XP/2000:	C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data

	- Now go to the Subversion directory.
	- Open the "config" file with a text editor.

Under [miscellany], uncomment this line:
# enable-auto-props = yes

Under [auto-props], add these lines:
*.c = svn:keywords=Id
*.cpp = svn:keywords=Id
*.h = svn:keywords=Id
*.inc = svn:keywords=Id
*.sp = svn:keywords=Id
